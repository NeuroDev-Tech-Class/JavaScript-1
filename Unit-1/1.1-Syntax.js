// JavaScript Syntax

/*
Each line in Javascript contains instructions for the computer to execute.
Similar to Python, Javascript executes instruction line by line from top to bottom. 

Unlike Python, indentation at the beginning of each line is for readability only. 
However, it is standard practice to use indentation.

// or /*  <--- these symbols are used to indicate a line of code is a comment
Comments are ignored when code is executed
Coders use comments to help explain what section of code do, this helps with code clarity

In this course, comments are used to help explain coding concepts

/*
JavaScript is used for Web Development. 
When you go online and use a website, odds are that JavaScript is being used to make everything possible.

This first course will get you familiar with Javascript and how syntax works,
then we will use it to make webpages and other cool stuff!
*/

console.log("Hello World");
/* This is how we print in Javascript. Since Javascript interacts with webpages,
to print you always send it to the console (weppage)

In the terminal, type node

You can now execute single lines of Javascript in the terminal
Either type, or copy and paste the above line into the terminal and see what happens
*/

console.log(2+4);
/* We can also put an expression into a .log and it will execute the expression

Notice the semicolon (;) at the end of each line
In Javascript, we put semicolons at the end of expressions, variable assignment, and return values
You'll see more of how they are used later
